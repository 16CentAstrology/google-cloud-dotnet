- **If you are an individual writing original source code** and **you own the intellectual property**,
then you'll need to sign an [individual CLA][individual-cla].
- **If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work**,
then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA][corporate-cla].

You can sign these electronically (just scroll to the bottom). After that,
